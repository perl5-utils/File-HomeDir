Revision history for Perl extension File::HomeDir

0.50 2005-12-26 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org

  * Rewrote the guts entirely to split functionality out into
    platform-specific submodules, and to add more specialised
    code for Win32.

0.07 2005-11-09 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org

  * Near-complete rewrite to modernise and prepare to
    start merging in File::HomeDir::Win32.

  * "Traded" module in exchange for Data::JavaScript::Anon :)
  * Replaced Makefile.PL with Module::Install-based version that lists
    its dependencies in a platform-sensitive way.
    This also removes the need for evals.
  * Replaced tests with Test::More-based ones and improved
    coverage.
  * Put the platform-specific code into if ( CONSTANT ) blocks
    so they will compile out.
  * Otherwise cleaned up and improved the layout of the code
  * Added support for $ENV{HOMEDIR} and $ENV{HOMEPATH} on Win32
  * More-explicit testing before we return a path
  * Keep caching user home, but NOT "my" home in case the
    process changes user.
